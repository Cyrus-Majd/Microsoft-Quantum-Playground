# **OVERVIEW**

  The point of this repo is to keep track of my Q# projects as I learn the language and do some fun side projects. Q# is Microsoft's quantum programming language. It differs from Cirq and Qiskit in that its a funtional programming language and it's designed to be extremely high level (there is no notion of a quantum state or a quantum circuit of any kind). In this way, it's more geared towards computer scientists like me who want to focus mainly on the quantum algorithms rather than the nuances of the specific hardware models of whatever quantum computer the code is running on.  
  
  I wanted to do stuff in Q# because I've already coded QAOA in Google's Cirq and a chemistry simulation with VQE in IBM's Qiskit quantum computing libraries and I want to move to an even higher-level environment. Also its cool.  
  
  The way this is structured is that each directory you see on the level of this README.md file is a project. If you want to clone this repo, you can just open each project up in VS code and run my code. In my experience setting up a Q# dev environment is a little confusing, but if you follow this [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/how-to-command-line-local?view=qsharp-preview&tabs=tabid-vscode), it should be pretty easy. Follow the instructions for installing on VScode. Believe me the other options for setup are harder. And don't try writing code into a random file and slapping a .qs extension on the end hoping that it'll work, it wont :sob:  
  
  Alright have fun thanks for reading the readme :)
